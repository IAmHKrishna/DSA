<!-- MULTIPLE POINTERS -->
The Multiple Pointers pattern is a technique used to solve problems where you have multiple indices, often starting at opposite ends of a data structure (like an array) or tracking different positions. The goal is to minimize the use of nested loops and reduce time complexity by using two or more pointers in a single pass.

<!-- Divide and Conquer -->

This pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating
a process with a subset of data.
This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity
