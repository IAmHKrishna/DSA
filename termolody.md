sub-array 

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. It's essentially a slice of the original array that includes elements starting from one index and ending at another index. 

Example:
Consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4]. Some of its subarrays are:
[1]
[2, 3]
[1, 2, 3]
[3, 4]

Array Intersection
The intersection of two arrays is defined as the set of elements that are present in both arrays.

Example:
Consider the arrays [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3, 4]. The intersection of these arrays is [2, 3], which is the set of elements that are present in both arrays.
