Below is a step-by-step guide to create a MongoDB replica set using Docker.

---

### **1️⃣ What Is a Replica Set?**

A **replica set** is a group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set. It provides:
- **High availability:** Automatic failover in case of instance failure.
- **Data redundancy:** Multiple copies of data across nodes.

---

### **2️⃣ Using Docker Compose to Create a Replica Set**

Using Docker Compose simplifies running multiple MongoDB containers. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  mongo1:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongo1
    ports:
      - 27017:27017
    command: ["mongod", "--replSet", "rs0", "--bind_ip_all"]
    volumes:
      - mongo1-data:/data/db

  mongo2:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongo2
    ports:
      - 27018:27017
    command: ["mongod", "--replSet", "rs0", "--bind_ip_all"]
    volumes:
      - mongo2-data:/data/db

  mongo3:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongo3
    ports:
      - 27019:27017
    command: ["mongod", "--replSet", "rs0", "--bind_ip_all"]
    volumes:
      - mongo3-data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo1-data:
  mongo2-data:
  mongo3-data:
```

**Notes:**
- Each container runs `mongod` with the `--replSet` flag, naming the replica set `"rs0"`.
- `--bind_ip_all` allows connections from any IP address (adjust as needed for production).
- Each service maps its internal MongoDB port `27017` to a different host port (27017, 27018, 27019).

### **3️⃣ Start the Replica Set Containers**

Run the following command in the directory with your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts three MongoDB containers.

---

### **4️⃣ Initialize the Replica Set**

1. **Connect to one of the MongoDB containers** (e.g., `mongo1`) using `docker exec`:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it mongo1 mongosh
   ```

2. **Initialize the Replica Set:**

   In the Mongo shell, run:

   ```javascript
   rs.initiate({
     _id: "rs0",
     members: [
       { _id: 0, host: "mongo1:27017" },
       { _id: 1, host: "mongo2:27017" },
       { _id: 2, host: "mongo3:27017" }
     ]
   })
   ```

   **Note:**  
   - Use container names (e.g., `"mongo1"`) as hostnames because Docker Compose sets up an internal network.

3. **Verify the Replica Set Status:**

   Run:

   ```javascript
   rs.status()
   ```

   You should see all three members listed with their roles (PRIMARY, SECONDARY).

---

### **5️⃣ Connecting from Your Application**

To connect from an application (for example, Node.js), use a connection string similar to:

```javascript
const mongoURI = "mongodb://mongo1:27017,mongo2:27017,mongo3:27017/mydb?replicaSet=rs0";
```

If you're connecting from your host machine, replace the container names with `localhost` and the mapped ports:

```javascript
const mongoURI = "mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/mydb?replicaSet=rs0";
```

---

### **6️⃣ Key Takeaways**

- **Replica Set Benefits:** High availability and data redundancy.
- **Docker Compose:** Simplifies running multiple containers.
- **Initialization:** Use `rs.initiate()` in the Mongo shell after starting the containers.
- **Connection String:** Include all replica set members and specify the `replicaSet` name.
