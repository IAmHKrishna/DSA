**Abstraction** is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes appropriate to the problem, and working at the most relevant level of inheritance for a particular aspect of the problem. In essence, abstraction hides the complex implementation details and exposes only the necessary and relevant parts of an object or system. This makes code easier to manage, understand, and maintain.

In JavaScript, abstraction can be achieved using various techniques, such as:

1) **Using Classes and Methods**
2) **Leveraging Closures for Data Privacy**
3) **Utilizing Modules to Encapsulate Functionality**


Let's delve into each of these methods with examples to understand how abstraction works in JavaScript.

1. **Using Classes and Methods**
JavaScript ES6 introduced the class syntax, which provides a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance. Classes allow you to define blueprints for objects, encapsulating data and behavior.

Example: Abstraction with Classes
Imagine you are creating a system to manage different types of vehicles. You want to provide a simple interface for interacting with vehicles without exposing their complex internal workings.



**2. Leveraging Closures for Data Privacy**
JavaScript's closure feature allows you to create private variables and functions. By using closures, you can encapsulate data, ensuring that certain parts of your code remain inaccessible from the outside, thus maintaining a clear abstraction layer.

**Example: Abstraction with Closures**
Let's create a simple BankAccount abstraction where the account balance is private and can only be modified through specific methods.
