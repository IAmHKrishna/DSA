**Polymorphism** in JavaScript refers to the ability of different objects to be accessed through the same interface. It allows objects of different types to respond to the same method call in their own way. In simpler terms, polymorphism means "many forms," and it lets one function work in different ways depending on the object it is called on.

There are two main types of polymorphism:

* **Method Overriding** (used in inheritance)
* **Method Overloading** (JavaScript doesn't natively support this but can be simulated)


1. **Polymorphism with Method Overriding:**
In JavaScript, polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding, which occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.


2. **Simulating Method Overloading (Polymorphism):**
JavaScript doesn't support function overloading in the traditional sense (like other languages such as Java or C++), but we can achieve similar behavior using arguments or by checking the types and number of parameters passed to a function.
