[S.O.L.I.D The first 5 principles of Object Oriented Design with JavaScript](https://medium.com/@cramirez92/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-5-priciples-of-object-oriented-design-with-javascript-790f6ac9b9fa)

The S.O.L.I.D. principles are five key design principles in object-oriented programming that help make software more maintainable, scalable, and testable. They can be effectively applied to JavaScript, even though JavaScript is not a strictly object-oriented language. Here's an explanation of each principle and its implementation in JavaScript:



S: Single Responsibility Principle - One responsibility per module/class.
O: Open/Closed Principle - Extend functionality without modifying existing code.
L: Liskov Substitution Principle - Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
I: Interface Segregation Principle - Avoid forcing classes to implement unused methods.
D: Dependency Inversion Principle - Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
